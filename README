# Assignment 1

## Information about the repository

This repository contains the following:
- Starter code: `points2d.h`, `test_points2d.cc`,`test_input_file.txt`, `expected_output.txt`, `Makefile` and `README.md`
- Assignment specification: `Spring23-Assignment1.pdf`

## Running the assignment

You will use this exact `Makefile` for your Assignment 1. Failure to do so will result in *deduction* of points.

To compile on terminal, type:

```bash
make clean
make all
```

To delete executables and object files, type:

```bash
make clean
```

To run, type:

```bash
./test_points2d
```

## Providing Input from Standard Input

To run with a given file that is redirected to standard input:

```bash
./test_points2d < test_input_file.txt
```
# Overview of Big 5 Implementation 

### 1. Default Constructor

**Purpose:**
Initializes an empty object.

**Implementation details:**
* Prevents undefined behavior from uninitialized pointer

### 2. Destructor

**Purpose:**
Frees dynamically allocated memory when the object is destroyed.

**Implementation details:**
* This prevents memory leaks.

### 3. Copy Constructor

**Purpose:**
Creates a new object as a deep copy of another object.

**Implementation details:**
* Allocates new memory
* Copies each point individually

### 4. Copy Assignment Operator

**Purpose:**
Assigns one object to another after both already exist.

**Implementation details:**
* Handle self-assignment safely
* Free old memory
* Allocate new memory
* Copy contents

### 5. Move Constructor

**Purpose:**
Transfers ownership of memory from one object to another without copying.

**Implementation details:**
* The source object becomes empty and safe.

### 6. Move Assignment Operator

**Purpose:**
Transfers ownership during assignment.

**Implementation details:**
Prevents memory leaks and double deletion.

### Stream Insertion Operator (<<)

**Purpose:**
Prints points in format:

### Stream Extraction Operator (>>)

**Purpose:**
Reads input in format: Allocates memory dynamically based on input size.

### Operator []

**Purpose:**
Provides indexed access to points. Includes bounds checking.

### Operator +

**Purpose:**
Adds two Points2D objects element-wise. If sizes differ, remaining elements are copied from larger object.
